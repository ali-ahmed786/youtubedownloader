This web app has been developed with a HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend and a Python Django backend. It allows the user to insert a URL of a YouTube video, and download the video (from a range of available video resolutions). If the user wishes to download just the audio from a YouTube video, it allows them to do that as well. This is done by converting the downloaded mp4 file into an mp3 file using moviepy.
